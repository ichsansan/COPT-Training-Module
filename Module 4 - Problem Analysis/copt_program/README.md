# Boiler Combustion Optimizer API SOKET 2
In order to run the 'api' for project SOKET #2 we can use for example PyCharm. For running the files in PyCharm, once we've configured our virtual environment on our local machine, it is inpurtant to set the option `Mark Directory as source root` with the right mouse click from the PyCHarm Project File explorer for the folder container of our repository content.

In VS Code we can set up our workspace by working with the command prompt and navigating to our repository directory. There we can type `code .` and the VS code will open in the directory as a work space. In the folder `.vscode` we can find the configurations of our VS Code workspace called `settings.json`. In order run and work with the python files in the repository we have to configure a virtual environment with VS Code. This can happen again via the command prompt by navigating to the repository folder and inside we execurte the following command `python -m venv .venv` where `.venv` is the name of the environment folder.

For library version control we use the package `freeze`. When we clone our repository and we've configured VS Code as described above, we have to simply exwcute the following command in the VS Code Terminal in order to install the packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you want to include some extra packages simply execute again in the VS Code Terminal `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. **Be careful by the packages you include, so that we use only the packages necessery for running the repository. You can ensure that by using the created virtual environment exclusively only for that particular repo.**
