# Combustion Optimization with Machine Learning Training Module

## Overview

Welcome to the Combustion Optimization with Machine Learning Training Module! This module is designed to provide a comprehensive guide on building, developing, deploying, and problem analyzing for a Combustion Optimization Machine Learning (ML) system. By the end of this training, you will have the knowledge and skills to create an efficient and effective ML system for combustion optimization.

## Submodules

### 1. Introduction to Building a Combustion Optimization ML System

In this submodule, participants will get acquainted with the fundamental concepts of combustion optimization and how Machine Learning can enhance the process. The module covers an overview of key technologies and tools, the advanced use of Python 3, and the role of ML in optimization.

### 2. Development of End-to-End Machine Learning System

This submodule focuses on the practical aspects of developing a complete end-to-end ML system for combustion optimization. Participants will learn about data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Once your model is ready, we'll show you how to deploy it on your localhost using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Hands-on exercises and case studies will be included to reinforce the theoretical concepts. 

### 3. Machine Learning Deployment and Integration on Linux Servers

Once the ML model is developed, the next step is deploying it for real-world use. This submodule delves into the deployment and integration aspects, with a specific focus on Linux servers. Participants will explore containerization, server and databases setup, and best practices for ensuring a smooth deployment process.

### 4. Problem Analyzing for Combustion Optimization ML System

In this submodule, participants will learn how to identify and troubleshoot issues that may arise in a combustion optimization ML system. Topics include performance monitoring, error handling, and debugging. Real-world scenarios and case studies will be discussed to provide practical insights into problem-solving.
