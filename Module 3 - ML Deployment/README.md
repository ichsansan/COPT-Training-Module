# 3. Machine Learning Deployment and Integration on Linux Servers

Welcome to the "Machine Learning Deployment and Integration on Linux Servers" submodule. In this section, we'll guide you through the essential steps of connecting to a database and deploying your Combustion Optimization Machine Learning model on a Linux server using containerization.

## Module Overview:

1. **Database Connection:**
   - Learn how to establish a connection to a database to seamlessly integrate your machine learning system with live data.
   - Explore common database technologies and understand the principles of connecting to databases using Python.
2. **Containerization with Docker:**
   - Dive into the world of containerization with Docker to package your machine learning application and its dependencies.
   - Understand the benefits of containerization for deployment, scalability, and reproducibility.
3. **Integration with Flask:**
   - Explore the integration of your machine learning model with Flask, a web framework, for robust and scalable web service deployment.
   - Learn how to expose your machine learning model as a RESTful API.

## Prerequisites:

Before starting this submodule, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Database Setup:**
   - A running database instance (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with sample data for integration.
2. **Docker Installation:**
   - Docker installed on your local machine or the server where you plan to deploy the machine learning system. You can install Docker by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
3. **Basic Knowledge of Flask:**
   - Familiarity with the basics of Flask for web service development. If you're new to Flask, consider reviewing the Flask documentation [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   - If you haven't already, clone the main repository to your local machine:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ichsansan/COPT-Training-Module.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Deployment Submodule:**

   - Move to the submodule dedicated to deployment.

     ```bash
     cd "COPT-Training-Module/Module 3 - Machine Learning Deployment"
     ```

3. **Explore the README File:**

   - Open the README file for this submodule (`Module 3 - Machine Learning Deployment/README.md`) for detailed instructions on connecting to a database, containerizing your application with Docker, and deploying the machine learning model on a Linux server.
